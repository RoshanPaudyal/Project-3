# Project-3

This algorithm utilizes machine learning and neural network techniques to predict the success rate of customer purchases by analyzing factors such as bounce rate, revenue, visitor type (new or returning), and special day. By incorporating these parameters and variables, the algorithm generates accurate predictions of customer behavior and purchase likelihood. With a large dataset and adaptability to changing customer behavior, this tool provides businesses with data-driven insights to optimize their marketing efforts and increase sales and revenue.
