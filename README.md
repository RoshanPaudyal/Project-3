# Project-3

Executive Summary

•	Objective: Develop a model to predict the success rate of customer purchases.
•	Models Used: Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Random Forest Classifier.
•	Recommendation: Random Forest Classifier due to its highest Training Data Accuracy (99.09%) and Test Data Accuracy (89.38%).
•	Feature selection was considered, but it resulted in lower accuracy scores.
•	Potential Application: Optimizing marketing strategies and resource allocation to increase sales and revenue.


Concept

•	Predicting customer purchase success rate using machine learning techniques.
•	Leveraging variables related to user behaviour, website interactions, and administrative factors.
•	Goal: Provide businesses with insights to optimize marketing strategies and resource allocation.


Data Collection, Clean-up, and Exploration

•	Dataset: UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository dataset.
•	Variables: Page values, Product Related Duration, Exit Rates, Bounce Rates, Product Related, Administrative Duration, Month, Administrative, Region, and Informational Duration.
•	Data Clean-up: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset.
•	Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.



Approach

•	Model Selection:
•	Neural Networks: Explored the use of artificial neural networks.
•	K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN): Utilized the KNN algorithm.
•	Random Forest Classifier: Recommended model due to its high Training Data Accuracy (99.09%) and Test Data Accuracy (89.38%).
•	Model Training and Evaluation:
•	Split dataset into training and testing sets.
•	Train each model using the training data.
•	Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.
•	Random Forest Classifier outperformed other models.
•	Feature selection was attempted but resulted in lower prediction scores.


Demo

•	Showcase the functionality and performance of the Random Forest Classifier.
•	Present a sample prediction using new input data.
•	Highlight the model's ability to predict the success rate of customer purchases.


Next Steps

•	Utilize the developed model to help businesses optimize their marketing strategy and allocate resources effectively.
•	Provide personalized recommendations to improve customer engagement and conversion rates.
•	Fine tune the model by adjusting the parameters and training parameters to optimise effectiveness.
•	Continuously monitor and update the model to adapt to changing customer behaviours and market trends.
•	Obtain more data to potentially increase the accuracy of scores.
•	Explore additional datasets or features that may enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
•	Collaborate with businesses to implement the model and measure its impact on sales and revenue.
•	Fine tune the model by adjusting the parameters and training parameters to optimise performance.
